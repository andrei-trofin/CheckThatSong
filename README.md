# CheckThatSong


This app keeps track of certain songs that the user marks as favorites.
When you don;t have internet and you want to remember a song that you just heard and liked,
an app dedicated to this is probably better than a text editor. 
So basically there should exist a pre-built database with songs and artists 
through which the user could search and att to favorites or he has an option to add
them manually as [Artist] [SongTitle] and optionally [Album] [Genre] and [Year]. 
If the database will prove to be too complicated, manually adding songs will suffice.

As to the requirements part I thought of the following:

*Input form - as I have stated [Artist] [SongTitle] (required) and [Album] [Genre] [Year] (optional)
*List of items - the list of favorite songs
*Chart - how many songs belonging to each specific genre you have and 
	 how many songs you discovered per week
*Authentication - every user should be able to authenticate in the app or by google/facebook
*Offline support - only the favorite songs should be stored locally, so the search option 
		   (if there will exist) should be available only online
*Online support - be able to go to a certain song through a youtube link linked to this app
*Intent - sent e-mail/message with some selected favorite songs to share with friends
*Animations - pop-ups with achievements (e.g. you added your 5th song, Hooray! or you added your 100th song,
	Get a life! and so on)
	+ alarms to remind you to check in the app
*Optional - get a song recommendation when you open the app(Song of the day) or something 
	    which should be valid for the current session
